Instantiating a class in many languages looks similar to that in C++, 
DinnerPlate *myPlate = new DinnerPlate(). 
What is the main difference between Python and Swift for achieving the same goal?

the absence of the word new

A class Dog has the following constructors:
public Dog() 
public Dog(String breed)
public Dog(int weight)
How would you instantiate a Dog with the weight set in Java?

Dog Fido = new Dog(63);
